This will turn someting like `mt0` into `marginTop: 0` or `jfcsb` into `justifyContent: 'space-between'`.  
Check out [the emmet docs on css abbreviations](https://docs.emmet.io/css-abbreviations/#css-abbreviations) to learn more about how to use them.

Note that this package requires `emmet-atom` to be installed and activated to work.
